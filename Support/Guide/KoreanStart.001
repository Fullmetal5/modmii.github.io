<i>Note: MMM, is not compatible with Wii Motion+ remotes, try using an older wiimote without motion+ built in or a gamecube controller. If you don't have a compatible controller, double-click SD:\ExploitAppSelector.bat and select "..\YAWMM\boot.elf" to help you quickly switch the boot.dol\elf app that is launched by your exploit; or manually save a copy of YAWMM's boot.elf to the SD root (ie. SD:\boot.elf). Then repeat the exploit described above to launch Some YAWMM Mod instead of MMM to install IOS58.</i><br>

<ol type="A">
<li><b>On your Wii, in Multi-Mod Manager's main menu, go down to select "WAD Manager"</b>.

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you cannot load your SD card, select "Load another IOS", then select IOS36.</b>
	<li>If the Wii was previously softmodded, you can also try loading IOS250 (or others like 251, 222, etc.)</b>
	</ul>

<li><b>Install IOS58-64-v6176</b>.

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Navigate to the WAD and press the <kbd>A</kbd> button twice to install the IOS individually.
	<li>Be careful not to install any additional WADs that may have been previously saved in this folder (they may be safe, but I cannot say for sure).
	<li>Make sure the file installs properly before continuing.
	</ul>

<li>After successfully installing IOS58, <b>press any button to continue.</b>


<li>Then <b>press the <kbd>B</kbd> button</b> to go back to MMM's main menu.
<li><b>Choose "App Manager"</b> then press <kbd>A</kbd>.
<li><b>Launch "HackMii_Installer"</b> by navigating to it and pressing the <kbd>A</kbd> button.
</ol>

<i>If you used YAWMM instead of MMM because of lack of Wii Motion+ controller support, double-click SD:\ExploitAppSelector.bat and select "..\HackMii_Installer\boot.elf" to help you quickly switch the boot.dol\elf app that is launched by your exploit; or manually save a copy of the HackMii Installer's boot.elf to the SD root (ie. SD:\boot.elf). Then repeat the exploit described above to launch the HackMii Installer.

This will launch YAWM ModMii Edition unless you are using str2hax without an SD Card (str2hax will launch the HackMii Installer if SD:\boot.elf is not found).<br>
<br>
If you don't have an SD Card, the HBC or a Forwarder Channel then either perform an official update to 4.3 and repeat the ModMii Wizard, or get an SD Card, or try your luck and see if the HackMii Installer will run on your Wii as is without first installing IOS58. If you are able to skip installing IOS58 and manage to install the HBC and Bootmii, be sure to also install IOS58 when you get to the Install WADs step later.<br>

<i>YAWM ModMii Edition stands for Yet Another Wad Manager ModMii Edition (aka yawmME). A WAD Manager will allow you to install "WADs" containing things like updates and other content for your console, like IOSs, custom IOSs (or cIOSs), or other downloadable content, which can be all packed into WADs and installed to your Wii. Think of a WAD like a zip file but for the Wii.</i><br>
<br>

WARNING: WADs can also be <u>un</u>installed, and if you're not careful you can brick your console by uninstalling or even installing the wrong WAD. The WAD Manager you're using, YAWM ModMii Edition, has some extra brick protection built in to restrict someone from doing catastrophic things like uninstalling any System Menu WAD, or required System Menu IOS, or a dozen other things which could potentially result in a brick if you don't know what you're doing. Stick to your ModMii guide and you'll be fine.<br>

		<li>To manually "install" apps, download your homebrew and you should find a boot.dol (or boot.elf) file and possibly an icon.png and meta.xml.
		<li>For the HBC to read your SD/USB correctly, your card must be structured SD:/apps/application name/boot.dol
		<li>Some apps require a meta.xml be saved in the same place as the boot.dol to work properly (icon.png is always optional).
		<li>If you have a dol or elf file not named "boot", rename it boot.dol (or boot.elf), otherwise it will not be recognized by the HBC (not required if using Priiloader to install a file from the root of your device).

<i>MMM has many tools, but we'll mainly be using it as a WAD Manager. A WAD Manager will allow you to install "WADs" containing things like updates and other content for your console, like IOSs, custom IOSs (or cIOSs), or other downloadable content, which can be all packed into WADs and installed to your Wii. Think of a WAD like a zip file but for the Wii.</i><br>
<br>

WARNING: WADs can also be <u>un</u>installed, and if you're not careful you can brick your console by uninstalling or even installing the wrong WAD. Stick to your ModMii guide and you'll be fine.<br>

<i>Fun Fact! I mentioned IOSs and cIOSs before, "the Wii console uses the 'IOS' system to communicate with the hardware, it's like a driver (compared to Windows). It contains information and communication tools (like how to access the Disc drive, how to access USB, read the savegames data stored on internal memory, etc.)" ~Cyan. If you're curious to learn more about IOSs or cIOSs, a thorough explanation can be found in <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/d2xl-cios-a-fork-of-davebaols-d2x-cios.558581/#post-8968173" target="_blank">Cyan's IOS Explanation post</a>.</i><br>

<ol type="A">
<li><b>On your Wii, in Multi-Mod Manager's main menu, go down to select "WAD Manager"</b>.

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you cannot load your SD card, select "Load another IOS", then select IOS36.</b>
	<li>If the Wii was previously softmodded, you can also try loading IOS250 (or others like 251, 222, etc.)</b>
	</ul>

<li><b>Install the <u>guidewadcountplaceholder WADs</u> listed below</b>.<br>

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Be careful not to install any additional WADs that may have been previously saved in this folder (they may be safe, but I cannot say for sure).
	<li><i>Fun Fact! Installing a clean/unpatched version of IOS58 should be enough to make the HackMii Installer happy, but we're (re)installing a few extra IOSs that the HackMii Installer is known to play nicely with just in case.</i>

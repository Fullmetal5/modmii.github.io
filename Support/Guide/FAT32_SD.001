<i>Note: If you don't have an SD Card, you can still accomplish <u>most</u> things using a Hard Drive formatted as FAT32 in place of an SD Card (SD is notably required for Bootmii and NAND backup). Make sure to always plug your hard drive into usb port0 - the one nearest the edge of the Wii. If you don't have an SD Card or Hard Drive, you can launch apps and install WADs over WiFi to your Wii from your PC. Just open apps (boot.dol\elf files) or WADs with ModMii. Note that some apps may not work properly or support all features if they require an SD or HDD and you should never attempt to change the region of a console via WiFi.</i><br>

<font size="5"><li>Launch YAWM ModMii Edition (yawmME)</li></font><br>

<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>Start the Homebrew Channel (HBC) and load YAWM ModMii Edition (Yet Another Wad Manager ModMii Edition). Once you've loaded it, move onto the next step.
<br>
<li>If you are missing the HBC or it is failing to load any apps, you will need to launch yawmME using another method.
</ul>

<br>

<b>Note:</b> if this Wii was previously modified, and it still has a Forwarder Channel installed, you can use that to launch yawmME instead of an exploit. Just save the boot.dol\elf from the app you want to load (ie. SD:\apps\yawmME\boot.dol) to the location used by your <u>specific</u> Forwarder Channel (ie. SD:\apps\usbloader_gx\boot.dol). Then start the channel and the app will load.<br>
<br>
If this is truly your first time modding your Wii, please continue with this step to launch an exploit. An exploit is a vulnerability in the Wii's software that gives us access to launch the tools we'll need to complete this guide.<br>

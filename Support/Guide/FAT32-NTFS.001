<b>If you have anything saved on the hard drive, you should back it up now as all the data will be lost once you format it.</b><br>
<br>
<ol type="A">
<li>Right-click "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Manage", a new window will open, on left panel click "Disk Management".
		<ul style=align="left" type="square">
		<li>If "This PC" or "My Computer" is not on the desktop it can be accessed using the <kbd>âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> keyboard combination.
		</ul>
<li>Right-click the drive you want to partition (make sure you select the right drive!), then select "Delete Volume..."
<li>On the lower half menu of the window, locate the unallocated space, right-click it, and select "New Simple Volume..."
<li>Enter the "volume size" you want your FAT32 partition to be, and click "Next".
<li>Choose a Drive letter for this partition, then click "Next".
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Make note of this drive letter, as it will be needed when we use FAT32 GUI Formatter shortly.
	</ul>
<li>Set the File System to "FAT32" (if possible) and optionally customize the "Volume label".
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>FAT32 will mostly likely not be an option (only listed if volume size is under 32GB).
	</ul>
<li>If FAT32 isn't an option, you can choose "Do not format this volume"

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>It's also okay to format as NTFS or exFAT since we will be changing it to FAT32 later.
	</ul>

<li>Click "Next", then click "Finish".
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you see a message indicating you need to format the drive, click "Cancel".
	</ul>
<li>In the lower half of the Disk Management menu, locate your drive's remaining unallocated space, right-click it, and select "New Simple Volume...."
<li>Click "Next" to format the all remaining space on the drive.
<li>Choose a Drive letter for this partition, and click "Next".
<li>Ensure the file system is set to NTFS, then name/label the volume, and optionally uncheck the "Perform a quick format" box.
<li>Click "Next", then click "Finish".
</li>
<br>
If you were able to format the first partition as FAT32, then you can skip the remainder of this step.<br>

<i>After you have completed this step and successfully (re)installed the HBC and Bootmii, you are finished with this guide and should continue with the main ModMii Wizard to update the rest of your softmods, starting with making a NAND backup.</i><br>

<ul style=align="left" type="disc">

<br>
<li>If you already exited MMM, you can load the HackMii Installer from the Homebrew Channel.
<li>If the HBC is failing to load any apps, instead launch MMM using the exploit described earlier, then in MMM's main menu, select "App Manager" and then select "HackMii_Installer" to launch it.
<li>If you used YAWMM instead of MMM because of lack of Wii Motion+ controller support, and you don't have the Homebrew Channel, double-click SD:\ExploitAppSelector.bat and select "..\HackMii_Installer\boot.elf" to help you quickly switch the boot.dol\elf app that is launched by your exploit; or manually save a copy of the HackMii Installer's boot.elf to the SD root (ie. SD:\boot.elf). Then repeat the exploit described above to launch the HackMii Installer.

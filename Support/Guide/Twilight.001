Requirements: A copy of "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess", a standard SD card (will not work with an SDHC card), and a nunchuck.<br>
<br>
<ol type="A"><li>Load the Twilight Princess game at least once (otherwise you won't be able to copy over the hack).</li>
<li>Delete or move\backup your personal "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess" save file.</li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you want to move\copy your save data to the same SD card with your ModMii files, first rename the SD:\private folder containing the exploit to something else. Then copy your save from the Wii to your SD Card and backup the new private folder with your save. Finally rename the original exploit folder back to SD:\private and reinsert the SD Card into your Wii before continuing to the next step. At the end of this guide you can restore the backup you made.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Go into Wii Options - Data Management - Save Data - Wii - SD Card then copy over the "Twilight Hack" save that corresponds to your game region.</li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li><b>Note for US users:</b> Look at the bottom of the game disc first. If it has RVL-RZDE-0A-2 USA in its inner ring, you'll have to load TwilightHack2 in a later step. If it says something else, load TwilightHack0.
	</ul>
<li>Insert the The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess disc and run the game.</li>
<li>On the title screen of the game, press <kbd>A</kbd> and "B" to go to the main menu.</li>
<li>Now load the twilight hack save file.<br>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Note: If you accidentally load the wrong file and continue with the hack, the game will freeze but do not panic, just hold down the power button on your Wii console for 5 seconds to turn it off, then turn it back on, and start over.</li>
	</ul>
<li>The game will start like normal. To execute the hack, talk to the first character you see, or try to leave the room.</li></ol>

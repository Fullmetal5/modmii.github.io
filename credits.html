ModMii was written entirely by me, XFlak; however, without the help of many other very talented people ModMii would not exist.<br>
Some people have contributed supporting files or programs, others have shared their knowledge, some have provided ideas and others have given their time.<br>
I have tried my best to recognize everyone's contribution to ModMii regardless of how big or small it is. If I've forgotten someone, please notify me and I'll add them to the credits as quickly as possible.<br><br>





<ul><li><font size="4"><b>Team Twiizers</b></font><br>
Thanks to Team Twiizers for creating the revolutionary HackMii Installer. Without their hard work, the Wii might never have been unlocked. Many Team Twiizer Members went on to join Team Fail Overflow; a team that played a vital role in unlocking the PS3.<br><br>

I especially want to thank Bushing (may he rest in peace), who before his untimely passing gave ModMii his blessing to download and use the HackMii Installer.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Giantpune</font></b><br>
Giantpune is a legend in the Wii Scene and I consider him to be a good friend of mine. He created many exploits, including the Smash Stack exploit for PAL and KOR Wii's (which is still the only method to fix 003 bricked Wii's), the Channel Forwarder dol, USB Loader GX, and many other computer programs to repair or virginize Wii's.<br><br>

He's contributed code to more projects than I even know about, so its impossible for me to truly convey his impact on the scene. He even took the time to explain a few things to me about cIOSs when ModMii was in its early stages and still known as NUS Auto Downloader.</li><br>


<li><b><font size="4">DeadlyFoez</font></b><br>
DeadlyFoez is legendary for his Wii Repairs and infectus tutorial. Anyone who's broken their Wii can email <a href="mailto:deadlyfoez@yahoo.com ">deadlyfoez@yahoo.com </a> to have it fixed.<br><br>

DeadlyFoez played a key role in the ModMii v5.0.0 update not only by helping come up with the idea for using html guides but also creating the template for ModMii's custom html guides and recording almost all of the videos and images they use. Within 1.5 weeks since our initial conversation we were able to collaborate and bring the idea to life in time to release it for Christmas. Working with him on this was a truly rewarding and fun experience. DeadlyFoez also single-handedly built the first official ModMii website.<br><br>

What can I say about THE "DeadlyFoez" on a personal level. He's always getting me into trouble but his friendship is worth every fiasco! It's unreal how he became one of my best friends. Just goes to show you not everyone you meet online is totally crazy; in his case... just a little crazy. But seriously, thanks to DeadlyFoez for always being there for me to bounce ModMii ideas off of, for hosting our Team Your Mom meetings and for introducing me to his awesome family and friends. There's no one else I'd rather geek out with and I'll always have your back.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Violator</font></b><br>
He's my bro, my cuz, my best man and the reason I ever bought or modded a Wii. "XFlak" would have died many years ago if not for him. Thanks Violator, for getting me interested in this stuff, and for all the awesome music you recorded for ModMii and my <a href="http://tinyurl.com/crazyintro" target="_blank">Crazy Intro Videos</a></li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">JoostinOnline</font></b><br>
Thanks for his work developing KoreanKii (with tueidj), Syscheck HD Edition, sharing his webhosting space with me, and for all his jokes; I'll never get tired of our endless patriotic "debates".</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Crediar, Daco Taco and Phpgeek</font></b><br>
The above people all had a hand in creating Priiloader. This was another revolutionary tool mainly because it was the first to offer some level of protection to newer Wii's that were unable to install BootMii at boot2. Crediar developed the original preloader as well as s/uneek, NMM, DML, etc. Special thanks to Daco Taco for being the last man standing in terms of actively improving/maintaining Priiloader.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Comex</font></b><br>
In addition to being a member of Team Twiizers and contributing to the HackMii Installer, Comex created the heavily utilized bannerbomb exploit. This exploit is what allows Wii's on firmwares 3.0-4.2 to be softmodded with only an SD Card instead of needing one of a few specific Wii Games.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Waninkoko</font></b><br>
Waninkoko was the first to publicly release a cIOS and other excellent apps like WAD manager, Save Game Manager, USB loader, etc. I also want to thank him for giving ModMii permission to recreate his cIOSs in WAD form.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Hermes</font></b><br>
Hermes is well known for his cIOS 222/223/224 and for his usbloader "uloader". For a time his cIOSs were the only ones to work with RockBand type games and they are still highly utilized today.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">davebaol and XFlak</font></b><br>
These developers worked together to modify Waninkoko's rev21 cIOS and created a new "d2x" cIOS. This cIOS is currently considered the ultimate cIOS because it corrected many bugs and added features that were previously thought to be impossible (ie. Support for IOS Reloading Games). WiiPower was also heavily influential in achieving IOS Reload Support.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Fullmetal5</font></b><br>
Thanks for his work developing the str2hax and bluebomb exploits. Fullmetal5 may have arrived a bit late to the Wii scene, but he's probably one of the most talented developers still active in the scene today. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Rodries</font></b><br>
Thanks to Rodries for improving upon Hermes v5.1 cIOSs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiGator</font></b><br>
WiiGator created a cMIOS and Gamecube Backup Launcher. Any GameCube fans owe a big thank you to WiiGator for his work.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiPower</font></b><br>
WiiPower created Neogamma, hands down the best backup disc loader for the Wii. He also modified WiiGators cMIOS and created what is today considered the ultimate cMIOS. Furthermore he's contributed code to many other popular usb-loaders and had a hand in adding IOS Reloading support to the d2x cIOSs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">OverjoY and obcd</font></b><br>
OverjoY created JoyFlow, a modification of WiiFlow that runs on s\uneek. He then teamed up with obcd to accomplish some seriously amazing things, like building their mod of s\uneek, NEEK2O, that allows it to load games in wbfs format and select from multiple emulated NANDs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Arikado and the Dop-Mii Team</font></b><br>
They created Dop-Mii; a lot of apps borrow code from Dop-Mii, so even if you have never used Dop-Mii but used MMM or WiiMod then you owe a thank you to these people.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiWu</font></b><br>
He made Multi-Mod Manager (MMM) which has the functions of many different Wii modding tools all in one user friendly app.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WB3000 and WiiNinja</font></b><br>
Thanks to WB3000 for creating NUS Downloader and to WiiNinja for making a cmd line version of NUS Downloader. NUS Downloader is one of ModMii's vital supporting apps.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiCrazy</font></b><br>
WiiCrazy is most famous for "Wii Game Shortcut Creator" (formerly known as "Crap"), Crazy Intro and Crazy Intro Video. He also contributed to usb-loaders by bypassing some game specific security. WiiCrazy is another person who's always been willing to do everything in his power to help me, or anyone else for that matter.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">oggzee, usptactical, gannon and Dr.Clipper</font></b><br>
Together the above people compose the Configurable USB Loader Team. Back in the day, this usb-loader was always the first to add new features and in my opinion it's one of the best usb-loader out there.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Cyan, dimok, blackb0x and the USBLoaderGX team</font></b><br>
Thanks for their work on USBLoaderGX. It is one of the most feature-rich usb-loaders and has quickly become a favourite among the community. I also want to thank Cyan specifically for his excellent support of users on gbatemp for many years; he has probably explained what an IOS is more times than I can count!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Wiimm</font></b><br>
Thanks to Wiimm for creating Wiimms ISO Tools, including wit.exe which ModMii uses to convert Wii Games to s/uneek format as well as build forwarder ISOs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">diddy81 and symular syn of the Wii Theme Team</font></b><br>
The Wii Theme Team has created some of the best Wii Themes ever made! All of the alternative themes available in ModMii were created by them. I want to thank diddy81 in particular for working with me to ensure that all his themes worked perfectly for all regions.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">FIX94, Narolez and the WiiXplorer Team</font></b><br>
Thanks to all these people for their contributions in making the best SD/USB forwarder. I want to thank FIX94 in particular who not only worked on 'Some YAWMM Mod' but also spent a lot of time testing ModMii's Forwarder Builder... he might be young, but he is wise beyond his years; just imagine what he'll be capable of when he's old enought to vote!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">jskyboo</font></b><br>
Thanks to jskyboo for creating WiiMod. His app can do a lot of different things, and it was the first ahbprot enabled WAD Manager to incorporate davebaol's ahbprot bugfix.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">ModMii's Translators</font></b><br>
Tranlating ModMii is an enormous amount of work. It's very challenging to get special characters to display correctly in a cmd window, not to mention keeping everything formatted properly. But probably the most difficult part of translating ModMii is keeping up with the updates. If you use a translated version of ModMii, I encourage you to thank your translator because it truly is a LOT of work to do.<br><br>

French Translators: <b>mamule, xav91 and ketufe</b><br>
Dutch Translator: <b>Hielkenator</b><br>
Italian Translators: <b>Wasabi, Step and Robilyn</b><br>
Spanish Translators: <b>ledebene and Burton</b></li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Fig2k4</font></b><br>
Thanks Fig2k4 for WiiBackupManager. It was a pleasure beta testing it for you and sharing my ideas with you. I hope to see you around the forums again and that you continue working on your amazing program.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Foxlet and alexander1970</font></b><br>
Thanks to both of you for recording and editing some of the new videos embedded in ModMii's guides.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiShizzza, pepxl, RobGee789 and M3RK</font></b><br>
Thanks to WiiShizzza for creating ModMii's new icon and to pepxl for creating ModMii's original icon. I want to thank everyone who created a ModMii icon and submitted it into ModMii's new icon competition. <a href="http://gbatemp.net/topic/296772-new-modmii-iconlogo-candidates/" target="_blank">http://gbatemp.net/topic/296772-new-modmii-iconlogo-candidates/</a><br><br>

RobGee789 and M3RK did all the graphics used by ModMii Skin. It was a pleasure working with them, they were both very open to feedback and willing to "go back to the drawing board", so to speak, as many times as it took to get it perfect. Thanks guys!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">My Fellow Guide Writers</font></b><br>
Thanks to Larsenv, urmum_69, tj_cool, xzxero, burritoboy9984, ChokeD and mauifrog for their awesome guides. I especially want to thank tj_cool and xzxero for inviting me to join "The Crew" at the Complete Softmod Guide. I'll never forget how great it felt to be relatively new to the scene and to be invited to join you all as equals.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">DaMysteryMan</font></b><br>
Thanks for helping me understand the structure of a cIOS so I could better recreate it in WAD form. For those of you who don't know him, DaMysteryMan is most well known for his ever controversial app - DarkCorp (formerly known as cIOSCorp).</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">person66</font></b><br>
person66 has had a hand in many projects, but most noteworthy are his sharpii cmd line tool and his Universal Forwarder Creator. He also wrote an autoit script that is used to launch ModMii with an icon, arguments and other useful functions.<br><br>
Thanks for trading little bits of batch coding knowledge with me. It's great having a fellow batch coder for a friend; we are a dying breed, so keep up the great work with Universal Forwarder Creator and all your other projects.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Gannon</font></b><br>
Thanks to Gannon for bootopera, which I was able to mod to create the URL loader base dol.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">All My Beta Testers!</font></b><br>
It's because of you guys that ModMii is as stable as it is. Considering that ModMii is developed entirely in notepad without any kind of debugger or developer tools; it's pretty remarkable that ModMii has always been bug-free (albeit with a couple minor exceptions). Thanks for your never-ending devotion to quality control!<br>

Here's a list of some of ModMii's beta testers (in no particular order): scooby74029, DeadlyFoez, redia, Etheboss, JoostinOnline, person66, brausm08, geovalley, undeadsquirrel, mauifrog, FIX94, wolf, Larsenv, urmum_69 and Clutz450.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">You!</font></b><br>
Without you, there would be no reason for ModMii to exist. Thanks for using ModMii for all your Wii softmodding needs!</li></ul>

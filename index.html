Sample guides for <u>illustrative purposes only</u> are available <a href="sampleguides\index.html"><b>here</b></a>.<br><br>It is also capable of performing many other wii hacking functions like setting up a usb-loader and creating an emulated NAND. ModMii was also the very first official installer for the widely adopted d2x cIOS.<br><br> Even if your Wii's SD Card reader is broken or you just don't have an SD Card, you can use a Hard Drive formatted as FAT32 in place of an SD Card to complete the majority of ModMii's functions (SD Card notably required for Bootmii and making a NAND backup).<br> <br>The video below describes some of ModMii's many features:<br><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMz_R18Z5oQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br> <font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>What can ModMii do?</b></font><br><ul style=align="left" type="disc"><li>It can download all the files necessary to Modify, Upgrade & Downgrade your Wii System Menu</li><li>Update only your outdated softmods based on a SysCheck log from your Wii</li><li>Able to build a custom easy to follow guide to setting up a USB-Loader (including how to format/partition your external hard drive)</li><li>Install SNEEK, build emulated NANDs, and Batch Extract Wii/Gamecube Games for use with SNEEK+DI or UNEEK+DI</li><li>Load NEEK on a Wii without softmodding it using the Abstinence Wizard</li><li>Region Change Your Wii</li><li>Download individual IOS/cIOS files, Official Wii Channels, System Menus, Wii Apps, DML, etc.</li><li>Install patched IOSs without a wifi connection on your Wii</li><li>Customize Bootmii, Wad Manager and MMM start-up settings using ModMii Configurators to create a custom config files</li><li>This is also capable of building many different System Menu Themes (csm's and themed SM Wads)</li><li>Provides a solution for the upside-down homebrew channel and the HackMii installer No Vulnerable IOS problems</li><li>Advanced Custom Downloads Feature will allow you to easily patch and change the slot/version of IOSs/cIOSs.

Now all functions support Wii motion+ remotes and/or donot require manually changing SD:/boot.elf/dol in between guidesteps.</li><li>Guide optimizations, improvements and additions (e.g. GPT to MBRconversion, added 2 new HDD format options WBFS &amp; FAT32+WBFS,new/improved Youtube videos, re-ordered/combined/streamlined steps,etc.).</li><li>Added optional step to SysCheck Updater guides to carefully stub orerase unnecessary IOS slots that should be empty using stub IOSWADs.</li><li>UI changes: changes to icons, new default ModMii Skin theme, newModMii Skin theme selector, optional Launchpad Toolbar, optional ContextMenu (right-click) access to ModMii.</li><li>Complete GUI redesign of ModMii Classic Download Pages (excludingAdvanced Downloads Page).</li><li>(Re)introduced auto-updating and semi-auto-updating downloads.</li><li>Many new/updated downloads. Notably a dozen new PC Programs wereadded.</li><li>A custom uninstaller is now bundled with ModMii allowing you touninstall some or all of ModMii’s components.</li><li>App Updater: new feature added to File Cleanup function on mainmenu. Users now prompted if they want to check for updates toauto-updating apps detected on the device (excluding Dolphin and OSC),or to delete unnecessary files, or both.</li><li>Updated bundled version of NUS Downloader Command Line from v0.2 tov0.6. The old NUSD did not perfectly create TMDs. Imperfect TMDs werenot generally problematic and have been used without issues for manyyears. However, the new YAWM ModMii Edition will prevent installation ofany WAD that is not perfect for security reasons. As a result, many ofthe WADs in ModMii’s temp folder from older versions will be deemedinvalid going forward and will be automatically re-downloaded. Tocorrect the files in your temp folder all at once, download the itemsfrom the bundled “NUS_2023_Changes” download queue.</li><li>Other changes and bugfixes.</li></ul><h3>Drag and Drop:</h3><ul><li>If you can’t drag and drop it onto ModMii then it probably isn’t Wiirelated, because ModMii drops it like it’s hot!</li><li>Added support for dragging and dropping multiple items at once.</li><li>Added a new option to ModMii Classic’s main menu to open a File orFolder with ModMii, behaves same as drag and drop except it does notsupport opening multiple items at once.<ul><li>Includes ModMii Launchpad Toolbar Installer/Uninstaller to add orremove a quicklaunch-like toolbar to your taskbar giving you easy accessto drag and drop functions.</li><li>Includes Context Menu Installer/Uninstaller to add or remove “Openwith ModMii” to your right-click context menu (orShift-right-click).</li></ul></li><li>Added Drag and Drop support for many new file types and features,including:</li></ul><ol type="1"><li>nand.bin tools (nand.bin); Extract, Check, Clone or Defragment a Wiinand.bin file<ul><li>Extract a nand.bin into folder format structure to use as anemulated nand</li><li>Check a nand.bin using nandBinCheck to confirm it is safe to installon a Wii</li><li>Clone a nand.bin from one Wii to install to a different Wii usingPunetwiin; output is also automatically checked by nandBinCheck</li><li>Defragment a nand.bin for modest speed improvement and/or tocompensate for new bad blocks in old nand backups</li><li>Examples: nand.bin, anything.bin</li></ul></li><li>HBC Transfer Tool (zip, 7z, rar)[def]; wirelessly transfer apps tothe device selected in the Homebrew Channnel (e.g. SD, USB)<ul><li>ModMii supports transferring archives (zip, 7z, rar) both with andwithout an /apps/ folder (e.g. usbloader_gx or apps/usbloader_gx). Onlyone app per archive can be transferred at a time, and because the HBC’smanaging access is limited to the /apps/ folder any files outside of theapps folder will be skipped (e.g. roms, games, resources, etc.).Archives must include a boot.dol or boot.elf file in the app folder (butnot both); other files and subfolders like meta/icon/etc. will getcopied as well.</li><li>Examples: usbloader_gx.7z, yawmME.zip, anything.rar</li></ul></li><li>App Launcher (dol, elf); launch apps from your PC to your Wii viaWiFi, no SD/USB required<ul><li>Loads arguments from meta.xml and also allows users to add/removearguments</li><li>Examples: boot.dol, boot.elf, anything.dol, anything.elf</li></ul></li><li>WAD Sender (WAD, folder of WADs); install WADs &lt;8MB from your PCto your Wii via WiFi, no SD/USB required<ul><li>Examples: anything.wad, or any folder containing WADs</li><li>Sharpii (and WadInstaller.dll) by person66 is now bundled withModMii to enable this feature</li></ul></li><li>WAD Modifier (WAD); Modify Channel attributes (Title, Title ID, IOS,DOL, Fakesign) or IOSs attributes (Patches, Slot, Version)<ul><li>Examples: anything.wad</li></ul></li><li>WAD Unpacker (WAD, folder of WADs); unpack WADs<ul><li>Examples: anything.wad, or any folder containing WADs</li></ul></li><li>WAD Packer (unpacked WAD folder or component file - app, cert,footer, tik, tmd); repack WAD<ul><li>Examples: Any_Unpacked_WAD_Folder, or any file inside an unpackedWAD folder (e.g. 00000000.app, cert, footer, tik, tmd)</li></ul></li><li>CSM Theme Builder (mym, csm, folder of myms, folder of csms); Createcsm files to install Wii themes using MyMenuifyMod<ul><li>Examples: DarkWii_Purple.mym, Random_Theme_4.1U.csm, MYM_Folder,CSM_Folder</li></ul></li><li>SysCheck Updater (sysCheck.csv); update only your outdated softmods<ul><li>Old/existing feature listed for completeness</li><li>Examples: sysCheck.csv, or any csv that was created by SysCheck andrenamed</li></ul></li><li>App Updater &amp; File Cleanup (SD/USB Drives or Folders); UpdateApps and/or remove un-needed files<ul><li>App Updater is a new feature, described later in changelog</li><li>File Cleanup is an old/existing feature listed for completeness</li><li>Examples: W:, X:, COPY_TO_SD, COPY_TO_USB</li></ul></li><li>Emulated Nand Modifer (EmuNand Folder); Edit an Emulated NAND<ul><li>Old/existing feature listed for completeness</li><li>Examples: pl_us, or any folder containing an Emulated NAND SystemMenu; i.e. /title/00000001/00000002/content/title.tmd</li></ul></li><li>Load Download Queue (ModMii_Download_Queue.bat); Load a ModMiiDownload Queue<ul><li>Old/existing feature listed for completeness</li><li>Examples: ModMii_Download_Queue.bat, or any download queue that wascreated by ModMii</li></ul></li><li>Load Wizard Settings (Wizard_Settings.bat); Load Saved ModMii WizardSettings from previous session<ul><li>Examples: Wizard_Settings.bat, or any Wizard_Settings.bat that wascreated by ModMii and renamed</li></ul></li><li>Calculate Hashes (everything else); Calculate file hashes usingHashMyFiles<ul><li>Examples: anything.doc, <em>.</em>, New_Folder, any file or foldernot mentioned above</li></ul></li></ol><h3>Wizards &amp; Guides:</h3><ul><li>New recommended cIOS configuration. Changes have been agreed andcoordinated with wii.guide. A brief rationale for each recommended cIOSprovided below:<ul><li>Slot 248 base 38: only bases 38 &amp; 58 can play SpongeBob’sBoating Bash, and only 38 has USB keyboard support for AnimalCrossing</li><li>Slot 249 base 56: plays majority of games and a few that base 57cannot; preferred for slot 249 to avoid unnecessary IOS reloads underUSB Loader GX’s Auto IOS setting</li><li>Slot 250 base 57: plays majority of games and a few that base 56cannot</li><li>Slot 251 base 58: only bases 38 &amp; 58 can play SpongeBob’sBoating Bash, and only 58 supports the LAN adapter</li></ul></li><li>All wizards now use YAWM ModMii Edition (yawmME) instead of MMM andSome YAWMM Mod. Now all functions support Wii motion+ remotes and/or donot require manually changing SD:/boot.elf/dol in between guidesteps.</li><li>Guides will have users install Priiloader before installing WADseven if a new System Menu is being installed since yawmME is able toretain Priiloader installations. The only exception is in SysCheckUpdater guides where a custom system menu version is detected or the HBCIOS (IOS58) is missing/patched, as the Priiloader Installer will refuseto run without a clean HBC IOS and system menu version.</li><li>Removed step to reinstall the HBC with the HackMii Installer to useIOS58 (where it was included). This step is no longer necessary as theHBC is now updated as part of the Install WADs step.</li><li>Relevant guides now include a section on checking the Hard drivepartition style and converting from GPT to MBR if applicable.</li><li>Wizards no longer ask users to select a USB format type (e.g. FAT32,NTFS, etc.). Instead, applicable guides include all format options inspoilers along with pros and cons for each.<ul><li>In addition to FAT32 (default/recommended), NTFS and FAT32+NTFS,directions for two new format types have been added: WBFS andFAT32+WBFS.</li></ul></li><li>Partition style and format type information is included in guidesfor devices that were connected when the guide was generated.</li><li>Nkit Processing App, GameCube Backup Manager and CleanRip are nowalso downloaded when setting up a USB-Loader and referenced inapplicable guides.</li><li>System Menu 4.3 is now recommended instead of 4.1 if &lt;=4.0. Ifstarting on 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 the recommendation is still not changeSystem Menu versions. There is no benefit to 4.3 over 4.1, but someusers feel strongly about seeing the latest number and their message hasbeen heard.</li><li>Added IOS59 to active IOS download list for Japanese console only asit is a JPN exclusive IOS. ModMii Wizards will only direct Japaneseconsoles to install it.</li><li>All Youtube videos were either re-recorded or upscaled and a numberof new videos were created to support guide changes (e.g. YAWM ModMiiEdition).</li><li>Enhanced exploit descriptions to list supported firmwares and otherrequirements.</li><li>Updated DNS servers for str2hax exploit directions.</li><li>Wii Channels no longer supported by Nintendo (e.g. News, Wii Speak,etc.) have been removed from wizards (still available via ModMii’sDownload Pages). These channels can be brought back to life using theRiiConnect24 Patcher (now also available via ModMii’s DownloadPages).</li></ul><h3>SysCheck Updater:</h3><ul><li>SysCheck Updater will direct users to install a base 56 cIOS in slot249 and base 57 in slot 250; previously both this and the reverse wereconsidered acceptable. Base 56 is slightly preferred over base 57 forslot 249 to avoid unnecessary IOS reloads under USB Loader GX’s Auto IOSsetting. This change has also been coordinated with wii.guide.</li><li>d2x v10 beta 52 and v8-final are still considered equal to oneanother; however, both are considered inferior to v11 beta 1 by ModMii’sSysCheck Updater even though the improvements can be argued asrelatively minor.</li><li>Added optional step to carefully stub or erase unnecessary IOS slotsthat should be empty using stub IOS WADs. Stub IOS WADs are never builtfor critical or commonly used IOS slots (e.g. 80, 202, 222-224, 236,240-256, etc).</li><li>Any version of the HBC equal to or greater than 1.1.2 is consideredto be up to date.</li><li>Custom system menu versions (e.g. v65535) are now detected and usersdirected to install stock system menu versions. Custom system menuversions do not play nicely with Priiloader and/or system menuhacks.</li><li>Region mismatches are now detected (i.e. due to an incomplete regionchange) and users are advised to complete the Region Change Wizard tocorrect it before proceeding with the SysCheck Updater.</li><li>SysCheck Updater guides will now hide the last four digits of theconsole ID.</li></ul><h3>User Interface:</h3><ul><li>Slight changes to icons used by ModMii and the ModMii Installer.ModMii Skin icon is now a different colour.</li><li>Added new option to ModMii Skin to change its theme. Anyone at anytime can create a new theme and submit it to XFlak to share with allusers.</li><li>Default ModMii Skin theme changed to AuroraNemoia’s Nebula theme.Original theme still available via ModMii Skin’s theme selectoroption.</li><li>Added ModMii Launchpad Toolbar and ModMii Context Menu (Right-click)options; see Drag and Drop changes for more info.</li><li>Adjustments to main menu order and wording to be more clear and userfriendly.</li></ul><h3>Downloads / App Updates:</h3><ul><li><p>Complete GUI redesign of ModMii Classic Download Pages (excludingAdvanced Downloads Page).</p><ul><li>GUI interface with helpful tool tips displayed when hovering yourmouse over items.</li></ul></li><li><p>(Re)introduced auto-updating and semi-auto-updating downloads tomany Wii Apps and PC Programs that still frequently receive updates.</p><ul><li>Added an option for Auto-Updating downloads to skip update check ifpreviously downloaded and cached; disabled by default.</li><li>Downloads that are not auto-updating can now be refreshed duringupdate checks without requiring a full ModMii update. Database (DB)version/date information is listed in guides as well as ModMii Classic’smain menu.</li></ul></li><li><p>Added support to create custom v14 SD/USB Forwarder dols; v12still available just in case.</p><ul><li>ModMii’s USBLoader Forwarder channel was updated from v12 to v14.Also it now includes a forwarder dol to more easily autoboot thischannel directly from Priiloader. ModMii guides provide generaldirection on how to install and autoboot files in Priiloader.</li></ul></li><li><p>PC Program Start Menu shortcuts (optional) are now all organizedin a ModMii Start Menu folder instead of a separate folder for eachprogram.</p></li><li><p>If PC Programs are installed portably they will now be saved toDevice:/Program Files/AppName instead of Device:/AppName.</p></li><li><p>Adjusted naming convention for advanced user defined downloads tosupport some Wii apps not directly used by ModMii (e.g. cIOS installers)that expect this naming format to work without WiFi(e.g. IOS56-64-v5661.wad instead of IOS56v5661.wad).</p></li><li><p>Bundled new download queue “d2x_installer_bases_38_56_57_58” thatwill save d2x base IOSs in the right locations for the d2x cIOSinstaller (Wii app) to be able to work offline. The d2x cIOS Installeris not used by ModMii as it’s redundant, but should users prefer it, itis downloadable via the OSC or HBB.</p></li><li><p>Removed old/outdated Priiloader hacks.ini download, Dop-Mii, andWiiMod.</p></li><li><p>New Downloads:</p><ul><li>PC Programs:<ul><li>Open Shop Channel: auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>Dolphin (Wii Emulator): semi-auto-updated periodically but the appis able update itself</li><li>Nkit Processing App</li><li>GameCube Backup Manager: auto-updating from developer github</li><li>Ohneschwanzenegger (aka NUS NANDBuilder)</li><li>RiiConnect24 Patcher: auto-updating from developer github</li><li>ThemeMii Mod (Wii Theme Builder)</li><li>FileZilla (FTP Client): semi-auto-updated periodically but the appis able update itself</li><li>HxD Hex Editor: semi-auto-updated periodically but the app is ableupdate itself</li><li>Diskitude (Disk Usage Analyzer): auto-updating from developerwebsite</li><li>H2testw (SD Card and USB test tool)</li><li>HashMyFiles: auto-updating from developer github</li></ul></li><li>Wii Apps:<ul><li>ftpii (FTP Server for the Wii)</li><li>Not64 (N64 Emulator): auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>Homebrew Channel WAD (Open HBC v1.1.5 LULZ)</li><li>CleanRip</li></ul></li><li>Exploit:<ul><li>Twilight Hack Version 0.1beta2 [3.4 U/E/J]<ul><li>Added for completeness in addition to Version 0.1beta1 [&lt;3.4U/E/J], not used in any guides/wizards</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>IOS:<ul><li>IOS59 v9429</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Updated Downloads:</p><ul><li>YAWM ModMii Edition (aka: yawmME, Yet Another WAD Manager ModMiiEdition) replaced Some YAWMM Mod on ModMii’s Download Page 2. yawmME hasmany improvements over its predecessor, including the ability to retainPriiloader when installing a new System Menu, to launch apps, totemporarily disable region checks/protection to permit region changing,and more.

Download was refreshed silently before this ModMiiupdate.</li></ul></li><li>Homebrew Browser: auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>WiiMC changed to SuperrSonic Edition: auto-updating fromoscwii.org</li><li>FCEUGX (NES Emulator): auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>SNEX9xGX (SNES Emulator): auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>Visual Boy Advance GX (GBA/Game Boy Color/Game Boy Emulator):auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>Wii64 (N64 Emulator): auto-updating from oscwii.org<ul><li>Updated to WiiFlow Compatibility MOD by saulfabreg which has theability to autolaunch ROMs via arguments, via meta.xml or WiiFlow</li></ul></li><li>WiiSX changed to WiiSXRX (PS1 Emulator): auto-updating fromoscwii.org</li><li>SaveGame Manager GX: auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>WiiXplorer: auto-updating from oscwii.org</li><li>Cheat Codes (auto-updating) now downloaded in a single archiveinstead of individually and is much faster. The archive is updatedperiodically with new cheats from both codes.rc24.xyz andgamehacking.org.<ul><li>Old/slower Cheat Codes downloader is still accessible via ModMii’sbundled download queue “CheatCodes_For_AccioHacks”. Use this only if yourequire cheat codes to be named in AccioHacks compatible format. The olddownloader is faster than it was in v6.6.3 but still timeconsuming.</li></ul></li><li>Any Region Changer ModMii Edition (ARCME) updated to v1.0.6.Download was refreshed silently before this ModMii update.</li><li>MyMenuifyMod updated to v2.0.</li><li>NeoGamma updated to R9 beta 56 MOD r4</li><li>ShowMiiWads updated to v1.5.2 mod</li><li>postLoader updated to v4.7.96</li><li>Updated graphics for the following channels/WADs: postLoader, neek2o(nswitch), WiiFlow and switch2uneek.</li><li>Simple IOS Patcher and IOS236 Installer were updated with a new NUSendpoint; from http://nus.cdn.shop.wii.com/ccs/download tohttp://ccs.cdn.sho.rc24.xyz/ccs/download</li><li>Slight change to patched system menu IOSs based on IOS60. TMD wasupdated at offset 0x3E2 from 0x0001 to 0x8001 to indicate shared contentin order to save nand space when multiple IOSs with same content areinstalled. No functional difference other than saving nand space.</li><li>All CSM themes from ModMii’s Download Page 3 are now signed to avoidunnecessary warning prompts when being installed by MyMenuifyMod afterits 2023 update.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Other:</h3><ul><li>A custom uninstaller is now bundled with ModMii allowing you touninstall some or all of ModMii’s components (e.g. you can uninstall WiiBackup Manager while retaining ModMii, or vice versa, etc.).</li><li>App Updater: new feature added to File Cleanup function on mainmenu. Users now prompted if they want to check for updates toauto-updating apps detected on the device (excluding Dolphin and OSC),or to delete unnecessary files, or both. Latest versions will beretrieved even if the option to skip update check for Auto-Updatingdownloads is enabled. All actions continue to be listed onscreen forusers to confirm before proceeding with changes.</li><li>File Cleanup function updated to check for a few more apps to remove(e.g. HBB) and if a bootmii folder is detected it will be renamed tobootmii_off to prevent it from being accessed.</li><li>Updated bundled version of NUS Downloader Command Line from v0.2 tov0.6. The old NUSD did not perfectly create TMDs. Imperfect TMDs werenot generally problematic and have been used without issues for manyyears. However, the new YAWM ModMii Edition will prevent installation ofany WAD that is not perfect for security reasons. As a result, many ofthe WADs in ModMii’s temp folder from older versions will be deemedinvalid going forward and will be automatically re-downloaded. Tocorrect the files in your temp folder all at once, download the itemsfrom the bundled “NUS_2023_Changes” download queue.</li><li>When loading a download queue via ModMii Classic a saved queue cannow be deleted by entering a minus sign in front of the number(e.g. entering -1 will delete queue # 1). Previously queues could onlybe deleted by manually removing them from the temp/DownloadQueuesfolders.</li><li>The Open Homebrew Channel can be installed to emulated NANDs usingModMii’s Emulated NAND Builder or Modifier.</li><li>Removed option to keep a patched IOS36.</li><li>Added red font.bin option for SNEEK/UNEEK in addition to black(default) and white. Also clarified font.bin descriptions: White text onBlack background (formerly black), Black text on White background(formerly white) and Red text on Black background.</li><li>ModMii verbose option adjusted; now only impacts ModMii Skin andnandBinCheck but not wget (i.e. wget will always start minimized).Option can now also be toggled within ModMii Skin.</li><li>Minor changes to the ModMii Installer. ModMii Classic will belaunched instead of ModMii Skin after installation. Added Start Menushortcuts to website and ModMii installation directory. Updated graphicsto match the new default ModMii Skin theme.</li><li>Updated .NET Framework 3.5 installer for newer versions of Windows;only downloaded if detected as missing.</li><li>Improved support for custom paths with special characters like &amp;and ^.</li><li>ModMii will now work even if run from a network location without anassigned drive letter. The location will be temporarily mapped to a newdrive letter which will get removed when ModMii is cleanly exited. Notethat if ModMii is forcefully closed the new mapped drive will not getremoved automatically, and if done repeatedly it could result induplicate mapped drive letters. Habitually running ModMii from a networklocation is not advised.</li><li>Added some more Easter Eggs to ModMii Classic. Happy hunting!</li><li>Other minor changes.</li></ul><h3>Bugfix:</h3><ul><li>Fixed bug in ModMii Skin where downloads would fail if the downloadpath was set to the root of a drive. ModMii Classic never had thisissue.</li><li>Updated supporting apps (nusd v0.2, nusfilegrabber and libwiisharp)with new NUS endpoint used by 3ds and WiiU so they could continue toretrieve Wii files when NUS was offline from 2022/3/16 to 2022/7/6.Autopatcher previously released to hotfix this for older versions ofModMii.</li><li>Fixed bug where ModMii Skin would fail if entering S to skipentering a Mac Address for Wilbrand (i.e. to use Letterbomb).</li><li>Fixed issue where ModMii Skin was sending a blank “MAC:” argumentcommand to ModMii Classic when a &lt;2.2 system menu version wasselected. MAC only required if using the Wilbrand exploit on 4.3.</li><li>If an invalid neek “Rev:#” command line argument is sent to ModMiiit will now build the latest version instead of exiting.</li><li>Fixed detection of nswitch channel on emulated nands when runningModMii’s EmuNAND modifier.</li><li>Updated various dead links, including link for hypatia. Previouslyusers without hypatia (hy.exe) cached to their temp folder would bewarned about lack of free space when using ModMii’s Game Bulk Extractor.ModMii allowed users to continue anyway but now free space estimates areworking again.</li><li>font.bin now also included when building non +di variants of neek2oin order to access the overlay menu. Previously only included for +divariants.</li><li>Fixed bug when dragging and dropping a HDD or SD device onto ModMiito quickly access its File Cleanup feature.</li><li>Fixed bug in v12 forwarder dol builder that limited path length to204 characters instead of 255.</li><li>Fixed issue where SysCheck guides did not include a copy of thesupplied SysCheck if the download location was set as an absolute pathand not a relative path.</li><li>Fixed bug in ModMii’s d2x option where users could choose from just10 d2x versions instead of full list of alternate d2x versions.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Wii might self-destruct in 2023 according to<ahref="https://hard-drive.net/nintendo-announces-all-still-functioning-wiis-will-self-destruct-in-2023/" target="_blank">somenews outlets</a>.</li></ul><!-- Current Changelog --></div><br><a href="changelog.html" target="_blank"><font size="5">Click here to view the full changelog</font></a></center><br><p style="text-align:center"><a href="donations.html"><img src="Images/donate.png" height="95" width="109" border="0"></a></p></body> </html><!-- Ends the HTML above -->

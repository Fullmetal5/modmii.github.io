ModMii is completely free to use, ad free and open source. Any support will help me afford to treat my kids more often or enroll them in more fun activities like swimming lessons and other sports!

It's now easier than ever to donate to ModMii using my [my GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/xflak)!

### **Credits**
[ModMii](https://modmii.github.io/) was written entirely by yours truly, XFlak. Trust me, no one else is crazy enough to try to maintain a batch file that has grown so large and 'all over the place'. But without the help of many other very talented people ModMii would not exist. Some people have contributed supporting files or programs, others have shared their knowledge, some have provided ideas and others have given their time.

I have tried my best to recognize everyone's contribution to ModMii in the [credits](https://modmii.github.io/credits.html) regardless of how big or small it is. If I've forgotten someone, please notify me and I'll add them to the credits as quickly as possible.

### **About the author:**
ModMii started out as a small side-project back in 2010 as a simple NUS Auto Downloader script, and now the changelog is taller than me! I started this project in my 20s in my spare time and since then I've gotten married and had not 1, not 2, not 3, but FOUR boys, all ~2 years apart (but ModMii will always be my first baby, lol). I love being able to share my love for gaming and for the Wii with them, and with all of you! This is a passion project that has easily taken over 5000-6000 hours of just my time alone, and that's not counting all the hours spent from the legions of devs and testers who've supported ModMii over the years.

Not knowing that much about computers other than some excel tricks, I slowly built more advanced features on top of my original less efficient code that I'd love to rewrite if it wasn't such a daunting task. Throughout the journey I learned a lot from not just those in the credits list, but the incredibly supportive Wii community as a whole. I've gone from just being a "numbers guy" to my family's go to "tech guy", and I have this project, community and followers to thank for it.

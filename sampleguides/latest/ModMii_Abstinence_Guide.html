<i>Note: If you don't have an SD Card, you can still accomplish <u>most</u> things using a Hard Drive formatted as FAT32 in place of an SD Card (SD is notably required for Bootmii and NAND backup). Make sure to always plug your hard drive into usb port0 - the one nearest the edge of the Wii.</i><br>
<br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>First, insert your SD Card into your PC and determine if it needs to be formatted by checking the current Format\File-System of the SD Card.
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>Open "This PC" or "My Computer", right-click the SD Card you want to use, then select "Properties".
		<ul style=align="left" type="square">
		<li>If "This PC" or "My Computer" is not on the desktop it can be accessed using the <kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">âŠž Win</kbd>+<kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">E</kbd> keyboard combination.
		</ul>
	<li>Make note of the Drive Letter of the SD Card as this will be important later.
	<li>If the "File-System" is already FAT32, you can skip this step.
	</ul>
<li><b>If you have anything saved on the SD Card, you should back it up now as all the data will be lost once you format it.</b>
</ul>
<br>

<ul style=align="left" type="disc"><li>Launch FAT32 GUI Formatter from shortcuts on your Start Menu or Desktop.
<li>Make sure you select the correct drive letter corresponding to your SD Card.
<li>You may optionally uncheck the "Quick Format" box, then click "Start".
	<ul style=align="left" type="square">
	<li>When completed it should display "Done"
	<li>If you get an error indicating the device is in use, try again after first closing all of your file explorer windows, even the ones that weren't browsing the device.<br>
	</ul>
<li>Click the "Close" button.
</ul>
<br>

At this time you should copy the files ModMii downloaded to your SD Card.
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>The files should be saved here: "C:\ModMii\COPY_TO_SD" 
<li>When the files are finished copying to the SD card, you should safely remove your SD Card from your computer and reinsert it into your Wii and proceed to the next step.</ul><br> 
<font size="5"><li>Copy Files to the Hard Drive</li></font><br>Copy everything inside the COPY_TO_USB folder to the root of your FAT32 hard-drive\partition.<br>Then safely remove it from your computer and plug it into port0 on your Wii and proceed to the next step.<br><br>
<font size="5"><li>Launch an Exploit on Your Wii</li></font><br><br>
You only need to perform ONE of the these exploits to complete this guide.<br><br>

	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If the connection test does not work, make sure you have a working internet connection, then try again. If it still fails you should choose a different exploit.

<i>Fun Facts about str2hax! If a boot.elf/dol file is detected on the root of your SD card, str2hax will launch it instead of automatically downloading then launching the HackMii Installer. And did you know when str2hax is finished, it will reset your DNS to Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4? You can leave it this way or re-enable Auto-Obtain DNS, or change it to Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1, or use <a href="https://wii.guide/riiconnect24.html" target="_blank">RiiConnect24's DNS</a>, the choice is yours!</i><br>

<ol type="A"><li>Load the Tales of Symphonia game at least once (otherwise you won't be able to copy over the hack).</li>
<li>Delete or move\backup your personal "Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World" save file.</li>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li>If you want to move\copy your save data to the same SD card with your ModMii files, first rename the SD:\private folder containing the exploit to something else. Then copy your save from the Wii to your SD Card and backup the new private folder with your save. Finally rename the original exploit folder back to SD:\private and reinsert the SD Card into your Wii before continuing to the next step. At the end of this guide you can restore the backup you made.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Go into Wii Options - Data Management - Save Data - Wii - SD Card then copy over the "Tales of Symphonia" save that corresponds to your region.<br>
	<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
	<li><b>Note for Japanese users:</b> There are 2 different Japanese versions of the game. If your game is version "RVL-RT4J-0A-0 JPN" use the top save, if you have "RVL-RT4J-0A-1 JPN" use the second save.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Start Tales of Symphonia and load the save data.</li>
<li>Once the game starts (and you see a dog waving at you) press <kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">+</kbd> to enter the game's menu.</li>
<li>Scroll down to "Status" and press <kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">A</kbd>.</li>
<li>Then scroll down to the second character (named "Giantpune"). Highlight him, and press <kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">A</kbd> to launch the exploit and load your homebrew application.</li></ol>

<font size="5"><li>Helpful Hints on Using neek2o</li></font><br>
<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li>When loading an emulated NAND for the first time, it could take a long time to load the System Menu, but it will be much quicker the second time around.</li>

<li>If you have problems loading your Emulated NAND, copy cert.sys from an original nand dump to your emulated nand's sys folder.</li>

<li>If you would like to make a NAND backup of your Wii without modding it, double-click Casper2BootMii.bat saved to ModMii's Support folder and update the files on your SD Card. Then repeat the exploit step of this guide and this time you will be taken to Bootmii. You can make a Bootmii NAND backup following <a href="https://youtu.be/J9QyWw9a7u4&t=0m13s" target="_blank">these steps</a>.</li>

<li>ShowMiiWads can be used to decrypt your real Wii's Bootmii NAND dump (nand.bin) to use as an emulated NAND, and it can add custom
channels/WADs to an emulated NAND. ShowMiiWads is available on ModMii's Download Page 2.</li>
<li>When using SNEEK+DI or UNEEK+DI, you can access the Game/DI Menu by pressing "1" on the WiiMote. To access other settings (including Region Options), you must press <kbd class="keyboard-key nowrap" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 0.2em; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.2em rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background-color: #f9f9f9; background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #eee, #f9f9f9, #eee); color: #000; padding: 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.85em;">+</kbd> from within the DI Menu.</li>

<li>To add Games to the Game/DI Menu, you can use ModMii to extract Wii Games to your FAT32 USB External Hard Drive. neek2o is also able to load games from "USB:\WBFS" which means you can also use WiiBackupManager (available on ModMii's Download Page 2).</li>

<font size="6"><li><a name="Credits">Credits, Supporting Apps, and Sources</a></li></font><br>
ModMii was written entirely by yours truly, XFlak. Trust me, no one else is crazy enough to try to maintain a batch file that has grown so large and 'all over the place'. But without the help of many other very talented people ModMii would not exist. Some people have contributed supporting files or programs, others have shared their knowledge, some have provided ideas and others have given their time.<br>
<br>
I have tried my best to recognize everyone's contribution to ModMii regardless of how big or small it is. If I've forgotten someone, please notify me and I'll add them to the credits as quickly as possible.<br><br>

<ul style=align="left" type="disc">
<li><font size="4"><b>Team Twiizers</b></font><br>
Thanks to Team Twiizers for creating the revolutionary HackMii Installer. Without their hard work, the Wii might never have been unlocked. Many Team Twiizer Members went on to join Team Fail Overflow; a team that played a vital role in unlocking the PS3.<br><br>

I especially want to thank Bushing (may he rest in peace), who before his untimely passing gave ModMii his blessing to download and use the HackMii Installer.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Giantpune</font></b><br>
Giantpune is a legend in the Wii Scene and I consider him to be a good friend of mine. He created many exploits, including the Smash Stack exploit for PAL and KOR Wii's (which is maybe still the only method to fix 003 bricked Wii's), the Channel Forwarder dol, USB Loader GX, and many other computer programs to repair or virginize Wii's.<br><br>

He's contributed code to more projects than I even know about, so its impossible for me to truly convey his impact on the scene. He even took the time to explain a few things to me about cIOSs when ModMii was in its early stages and still known as NUS Auto Downloader.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">DeadlyFoez</font></b><br>
DeadlyFoez is legendary for his Wii Repairs and infectus tutorial. Anyone who's broken their Wii can email <a href="mailto:deadlyfoez@yahoo.com ">deadlyfoez@yahoo.com </a> to have it fixed.<br><br>

DeadlyFoez played a key role in the ModMii v5.0.0 update not only by helping come up with the idea for using html guides but also creating the template for ModMii's custom html guides and recording almost all of the videos and images they use. Within 1.5 weeks since our initial conversation we were able to collaborate and bring the idea to life in time to release it for Christmas. Working with him on this was a truly rewarding and fun experience. DeadlyFoez also single-handedly built the first official ModMii website.<br><br>

What can I say about THE "DeadlyFoez" on a personal level. He's always getting me into trouble but his friendship is worth every fiasco! It's unreal how he became one of my best friends. Just goes to show you not everyone you meet online is totally crazy; in his case... just a little crazy. But seriously, thanks to DeadlyFoez for always being there for me to bounce ModMii ideas off of, for hosting our Team Your Mom meetings and for introducing me to his awesome family and friends. There's no one else I'd rather geek out with and I'll always have your back.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Violator</font></b><br>
He's my bro, my cuz, my best man and the reason I ever bought or modded a Wii. "XFlak" would have died many years ago if not for him. Thanks Violator, for getting me interested in this stuff, and for all the awesome music you recorded for ModMii and my <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/x-flaks-crazy-intro-videos.189411" target="_blank">Crazy Intro Videos</a></li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">JoostinOnline</font></b><br>
Thanks for his work developing KoreanKii (with tueidj), Syscheck HD Edition, sharing his webhosting space with me, and for all his jokes; I'll never get tired of our endless patriotic "debates".</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Crediar, Daco Taco and Phpgeek</font></b><br>
The above people all had a hand in creating Priiloader. This was another revolutionary tool mainly because it was the first to offer some level of protection to newer Wii's that were unable to install Bootmii at boot2. Crediar developed the original preloader as well as s/uneek, Nintendont, NMM, DML, etc. Special thanks to Daco Taco for being the last man standing in terms of actively improving/maintaining Priiloader.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Comex</font></b><br>
In addition to being a member of Team Twiizers and contributing to the HackMii Installer, Comex created the heavily utilized bannerbomb exploit. This exploit is what allows Wii's on firmwares 3.0-4.2 to be softmodded with only an SD Card instead of needing one of a few specific Wii Games.</li><br>


<li><b><font size="4">Waninkoko</font></b><br>
Waninkoko was the first to publicly release a cIOS and other excellent apps like WAD manager, Save Game Manager, USB loader, etc. I also want to thank him for giving ModMii permission to recreate his cIOSs in WAD form.<br><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Hermes</font></b><br>
Hermes is well known for his cIOS 222/223/224 and for his usbloader "uloader". For a time his cIOSs were the only ones to work with RockBand type games and they are still highly utilized today.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">davebaol and XFlak</font></b><br>
These developers worked together to modify Waninkoko's rev21 cIOS and created a new "d2x" cIOS. This cIOS is currently considered the ultimate cIOS because it corrected many bugs and added features that were previously thought to be impossible (ie. Support for IOS Reloading Games). WiiPower was also heavily influential in achieving IOS Reload Support.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Fullmetal5</font></b><br>
Thanks for his work developing the str2hax and bluebomb exploits. Fullmetal5 may have arrived a bit late to the Wii scene, but he's probably one of the most talented developers still active in the scene today. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Rodries</font></b><br>
Thanks to Rodries for improving upon Hermes v5.1 cIOSs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiGator</font></b><br>
WiiGator created a cMIOS and Gamecube Backup Launcher. Any GameCube fans owe a big thank you to WiiGator for his work.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">cwstjdenobs</font></b><br>
cwstjdenobs is one of the few people I've encountered in the Wii scene that I would love to treat to a beer. He was always very supportive of me and encouraged me to ask him as many questions as I'd like. He is probably most well known for YAWMM (Yet Another Wad Manager Mod) which was the first Wad Manager to add brick protection by restricting users from making silly mistakes like uninstalling or stubbing a crucial file. He's also made and modified apps specifically for ModMii. For example, he modified WadMii so it doesn't timestamp WADs and he also made a setting.txt builder for ModMii's NAND builder.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Leathl</font></b><br>
Leathl is another awesome developer who supported me before I became well known by expanding upon his apps to further support ModMii. Leathl has created many Wii apps including ShowMiiWads, CustomizeMii, libWiiSharp, patchios, nusfilegrabber, etc. Despite his recent inactivity, his apps are still highly used today... just goes to show you that quality work never gets old. I also want to thank RetroHead for him Mod of ShowMiiWads which ModMii uses to build emulated nands without requiring any input from the user. libWiiSharp.dll is based on wii.py, the wii.py devs are Megazig, Omega, Xuzz, SquidMan, Matt_P and The Lemon Man. Also thanks to Daeken for writing Struct.py and marcan for his LZ77 code.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">scooby74029</font></b><br>
scooby74029's most well known for sneeky compiler, which is able to build multiple different versions of s\uneek. ModMii will always construct the latest version of s\uneek available on his sneeky compiler google code webpage. This means he has total control over what version of s\uneek ModMii will construct. He also created modifications of Leathl's libWiiSharp.dll and patchios.exe to further support ModMii. Additionally, he's modified other apps like JoyFlow, JoyLoader GX, JoyLoader CFG, etc. On top of all that, he's an all around awesome person and I'm proud to be on his friends list.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">person66</font></b><br>
person66 has had a hand in many projects, but most noteworthy are his sharpii cmd line tool and his Universal Forwarder Creator. He also wrote an autoit script that is used to launch ModMii with an icon, arguments and other useful functions.<br><br>
Thanks for trading little bits of batch coding knowledge with me. It's great having a fellow batch coder for a friend; we are a dying breed, so keep up the great work with Universal Forwarder Creator and all your other projects.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiPower</font></b><br>
WiiPower created Neogamma, hands down the best backup disc loader for the Wii. He also modified WiiGators cMIOS and created what is today considered the ultimate cMIOS. Furthermore he's contributed code to many other popular usb-loaders and had a hand in adding IOS Reloading support to the d2x cIOSs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">OverjoY and obcd</font></b><br>
OverjoY created JoyFlow, a modification of WiiFlow that runs on s\uneek. He then teamed up with obcd to accomplish some seriously amazing things, like building their mod of s\uneek, NEEK2O, that allows it to load games in wbfs format and select from multiple emulated NANDs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Arikado and the Dop-Mii Team</font></b><br>
They created Dop-Mii; a lot of apps borrow code from Dop-Mii, so even if you have never used Dop-Mii but used MMM or WiiMod then you owe a thank you to these people.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiWu</font></b><br>
He made Multi-Mod Manager (MMM) which has the functions of many different Wii modding tools all in one user friendly app.</li><br>


<li><b><font size="4">WB3000 and WiiNinja</font></b><br>
Thanks to WB3000 for creating NUS Downloader and to WiiNinja for making a cmd line version of NUS Downloader. NUS Downloader is one of ModMii's vital supporting apps.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiCrazy</font></b><br>
WiiCrazy is most famous for "Wii Game Shortcut Creator" (formerly known as "Crap"), Crazy Intro and Crazy Intro Video. He also contributed to usb-loaders by bypassing some game specific security. WiiCrazy is another person who's always been willing to do everything in his power to help me, or anyone else for that matter.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">oggzee, usptactical, gannon and Dr.Clipper</font></b><br>
Together the above people compose the Configurable USB Loader Team. Back in the day, this usb-loader was always the first to add new features and in my opinion it's one of the top three best usb-loader out there.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Cyan, dimok, blackb0x and the USBLoaderGX team</font></b><br>
Thanks for their work on USBLoaderGX. It is one of the most feature-rich usb-loaders and has quickly become a favourite among the community. I also want to thank Cyan specifically for his excellent support of users on gbatemp for many years; he has probably explained what an IOS is more times than I can count!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Hibernatus, Fledge68 and the WiiFlow team</font></b><br>
Thanks for their work on WiiFlow. It was always beautiful, but now it's got all sorts of bells and whistles, you should check it out.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Wiimm</font></b><br>
For Wiimmfi Thanks to Wiimm for creating Wiimmfi and Wiimms ISO Tools, including wit.exe which ModMii uses to convert Wii Games to s/uneek format as well as build forwarder ISOs.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Leseratte</font></b><br>
For his work on Wiimmfi, as well as d2xl and other amazing projects.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">diddy81 and symular syn of the Wii Theme Team</font></b><br>
The Wii Theme Team has created some of the best Wii Themes ever made! All of the alternative themes available in ModMii were created by them. I want to thank diddy81 in particular for working with me to ensure that all his themes worked perfectly for all regions.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">FIX94, Narolez and the WiiXplorer Team</font></b><br>
Thanks to all these people for their contributions in making the best SD/USB forwarder. I want to thank FIX94 in particular who not only worked on Nintendont, Some YAWMM Mod, WiiFlow and literally every other big Wii application, but he also spent a lot of time testing ModMii's Forwarder Builder.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">jskyboo</font></b><br>
Thanks to jskyboo for creating WiiMod. His app can do a lot of different things, and it was the first ahbprot enabled WAD Manager to incorporate davebaol's ahbprot bugfix.</li><br>


<li><b><font size="4">ModMii's Translators</font></b><br>
Tranlating ModMii is an enormous amount of work. It's very challenging to get special characters to display correctly in a cmd window, not to mention keeping everything formatted properly. But probably the most difficult part of translating ModMii is keeping up with the updates. If you use a translated version of ModMii, I encourage you to thank your translator because it truly is a LOT of work to do.<br><br>

French Translators: <b>mamule, xav91 and ketufe</b><br>
Dutch Translator: <b>Hielkenator</b><br>
Italian Translators: <b>Wasabi, Step and Robilyn</b><br>
Spanish Translators: <b>ledebene and Burton</b></li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Fig2k4</font></b><br>
Thanks Fig2k4 for WiiBackupManager. It was a pleasure beta testing it for you and sharing my ideas with you. I hope to see you around the forums again and that you continue working on your amazing program.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Foxlet and alexander1970</font></b><br>
Thanks to both of you for recording and editing some of the new videos embedded in ModMii's guides.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">WiiShizzza, pepxl, RobGee789 and M3RK</font></b><br>
Thanks to WiiShizzza for creating ModMii's new icon and to pepxl for creating ModMii's original icon. I want to thank everyone who created a ModMii icon and submitted it into ModMii's new icon competition. <a href="http://gbatemp.net/topic/296772-new-modmii-iconlogo-candidates/" target="_blank">http://gbatemp.net/topic/296772-new-modmii-iconlogo-candidates/</a><br><br>

RobGee789 and M3RK did all the graphics used by ModMii Skin. It was a pleasure working with them, they were both very open to feedback and willing to "go back to the drawing board", so to speak, as many times as it took to get it perfect. Thanks guys!</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">My Fellow Guide Writers</font></b><br>
Thanks to tj_cool, xzxero, burritoboy9984, ChokeD and mauifrog for their awesome guides. I especially want to thank tj_cool and xzxero for inviting me to join "The Crew" at the Complete Softmod Guide. I'll never forget how great it felt to be relatively new to the scene and to be invited to join you all as equals.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">RiiConnect24 and Wii.Guide team</font></b><br>
Thanks in particular go out to urmum_69, Larsenv and KcrPL. Brainstorming and collaborating with you guys made the 2020 lockdowns feel somewhat bearable. Special thanks to urmum_69 for helping me set up the ModMii discord server to a much higher standard than I could have ever hoped to do on my own.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">DaMysteryMan</font></b><br>
Thanks for helping me understand the structure of a cIOS so I could better recreate it in WAD form. For those of you who don't know him, DaMysteryMan is most well known for his ever controversial app - DarkCorp (formerly known as cIOSCorp).</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">Gannon</font></b><br>
Thanks to Gannon for bootopera, which I was able to mod to create the URL loader base dol.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">All My Beta Testers!</font></b><br>
It's because of you guys that ModMii is as stable as it is. Considering that ModMii is developed entirely in notepad without any kind of debugger or developer tools; it's pretty remarkable that ModMii has always been bug-free (albeit with a couple minor exceptions). Thanks for your never-ending devotion to quality control!<br>

Here's a list of some of ModMii's beta testers (in no particular order): scooby74029, DeadlyFoez, redia, Etheboss, JoostinOnline, person66, brausm08, geovalley, undeadsquirrel, mauifrog, FIX94, wolf, Larsenv, urmum_69, alexander1970, Cyan and last but certainly not least, Clutz450. @Clutz450, you're the man, I really enjoyed your ModMii tutorial videos and hearing your ideas on the little ways ModMii could be made even better.</li><br>

<li><b><font size="4">You!</font></b><br>
Without you, there would be no reason for ModMii to exist. Thanks for using ModMii for all your Wii softmodding needs!</li>

ModMii started out as a small side-project back in 2010 as a simple NUS Auto Downloader script, and now the changelog is taller than me! I started this project in my 20s in my spare time and since then I've gotten married and had not 1, not 2, not 3, but FOUR boys, all ~2 years apart. I love being able to share my love for gaming and for the Wii with them, and with all of you! This is a passion project that has easily taken over 4000-5000 hours of just my time alone, and that's not counting all the hours spent from the legions of devs and testers who've supported ModMii over the years.<br>
<br>
Not knowing that much about computers other than some excel tricks, I slowly built more advanced features on top of my original less efficient code that I'd love to rewrite if it wasn't such a daunting task. Throughout the journey I learned a lot from not just those in the credits list, but the incredibly supportive Wii community as a whole. I've gone from just being a "numbers guy" to my family's go to "tech guy", and I have this project, community and followers to thank for it.<br>
